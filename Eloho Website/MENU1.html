    <h1>26TH</h1>
    <p> So since I still suck at vulnerable communication here's an opportunity for me to tell you how amazing you are to me and the world, even though I think you should know that already, purr!</p>
        <p>When curating these photos. I went through my gallery, created a new folder "Eloho" and saved some of my fav photos of you. Only to go through my galley folders and turns out I had a folder of you already title "favourite person"😭
            So here's every moment we've shared together and every milestone you've aced and heartily shared with me.</p>
            <p>I was on a call with Owen the day before and went on rambling about your birthday and what effort I could put into getting you a present and work on this and he mentioned how I spoke about you in admiration like a character in Chimamada's dream count. It was funny.</p>
            <p>This is turning into a diary so check next slide for your birthday wishes but here's a few things I love about you</p>
            <p>* Your free and amazing spirit</p>
            <p>*Your non-judgemental persona</p>
            <p>*Your thoughtfulness and kindness</p>
            <p>*Your kindness</p>
            <p>*Your love for God</p>
            <p>*Your love for family</p>
            <p>*Your zest for life</p>
            <p>I know I have not said this to you before, but every person around me hears it always, you made me a better person, you make me want to be a better version of myself. I love how you push for me to strive for the best for myself and business(even though you scare me sometimes) so sad I don't have WhatsApp, some of my favourite conversations with you would have made it here.
            Here's a few moments that have stuck with me since knowing you in the order of the images</p>
            </p>
        <p>All this one na long talk because I never get money for your  Cybertruck 😭
            So today, I bless God or your life, I cant wait to see His plan for your life come to pass(Jer 29.11). I pray God fills the rest of your days with the light of His love, guide you and continually be your anchor in this journey called life.
        So you'll be getting virtual flowers till you see me in Canada.
        Cupcakes this week, because I couldn't get it in time (sorry)
        
        Cheers to 
        <p>.A very long and healthy life(Psalm37.4)</p>
        <p>.Never fading beauty(Num 6.24-26)</p>
        <p>.Never taking our friendship for granted</p> 
        <p>.Sound mind, body and spirit</p>
        <p>.To our families becoming friends</p>
        <p>.To our kids becoming friends</p>
        <p>To many milestones you'd accomplish</p>
        </p>
