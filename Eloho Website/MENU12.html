    <h1 class="ws">A bonus, is a draft of the message I had for you during your wedding reception.</h1>
    <p class="ee">
Good afternoon, everyone. I’m Onize, Eloho's maid of honour. As I stand here today, looking at the radiant bride, my beautiful friend in her wedding gown, I’m overwhelmed with emotions. Eloho, from the moment we met, little did I know then that I was meeting the person who would become my sister in all but blood.
Our meeting has been nothing short of divine arrangement. 
I remember the day you told me about your husband and your eyes lit up in a way I’d never seen before.  You talked about him with such joy and excitement, and I knew then that this was something special. Watching your love story unfold has been like watching the most beautiful thing.
She's a lover girl for real and I'm glad she has someone to share that love with and receive in greater measure. It is my prayer that your spark continually blossoms in your marriage.
Long before this day was even in sight we teased each other about the speeches we would give at each other’s wedding ceremony even though I may not say the speech you told me to rehearse. Above all I'm just really happy to be here today, keeping my own end of what was a playful discussion.

To Rawlings, you’re marrying not just a beautiful woman, but a beautiful soul and I want to specially thank you for the happiness you’ve brought into my friend's life. The way her eyes light up when she talks about you, the way she smiles when you show up, your thoughtfulness it’s clear that you’ve captured her heart completely. You’ve become not just her partner, but her best friend, her confidant, her safe harbour in stormy weather. It’s everything I could have hoped for my amazing friend
As you embark on your new life together I pray you always find comfort in each other’s arms. 
To the happy couple, may your love continue to grow stronger with each passing day.

May your life together be filled with as much laughter, love, and beautiful moments as you’ve brought into the lives of everyone in this room.
. Here’s to a lifetime of love, happiness, and friendship. Cheers!

Let’s raise our glasses to the couple. 

Here’s to a lifetime of setting goals, smashing them, and celebrating each victory together.
